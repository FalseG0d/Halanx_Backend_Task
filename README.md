## Halanx Owner App

Halanx Owner App is for the property owners who have to manage their property and tenants.

They need to register themselves into the app, add their properties and manage tenants who are staying in their properties.

*Note: If not mentioned in the code, make logical assumption on the things needed to be present for any task to be done by the owner.*

## Backend Task

In this task you have been provided with some sections of a django project which manages the Halanx Backend.

You are expected to create some APIs as listed in API section.

You will be working in *Homes.Owners* folder. All the corresponding utilities have also been include in the root directory for your reference.

Some APIs have been already created. Some might be working fine and some might have some bugs. This is done to help your development as well as debugging skills.

Once you have finsihed an API creation, mark the corresponding checkbox as checked in the API section.

When you feel your code is upto the mark, you can WhatsApp your repository link or Postman Collection *(if hosted)*.

*Note: Your might need to create a new project for checking the proper functioning of the project and APIs. You might host the project and provide a Postman collection for evaluation too.*

*Suggestion: Fork the repository into your own public repo for simplicity.*

## Evaluation

*Provide a doc for logic and changes in your code.*

Your changes will be ammended in the real development server and the API functioning will be checked using Postman.

*OR*

Your Postman Collections will be evaluated. *(Benefit will be given for this. Moreover you can provide this for being on the safe side)*
